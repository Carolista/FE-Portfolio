        "desc": "This browser-based app allows homeowners to define and customize a renovation project for multiple rooms and get a detailed estimate of the potential cost for each one. The project details form displays different categories and choices depending on the room type, and provides the user with updated estimates for each line item with every single change made on the form. Once finished with selections and adjustments, the user can save the estimate to revisit or modify later as desired.</p> <p>This project was completed in collaboration with two other LC101 graduates at LaunchCode. While initially I was heavily involved in the overall architecture of the data, my primary contribution was designing and building the front end.",

This is particularly useful when, after a few months, a student is focusing on new subjects but wants to keep previous knowledge fresh in their minds. Students can quickly make up a &quot;deck&quot; of cards with whatever combination of topics and categories they wish to include, see quick statistics on past activity and performance in all topics and categories, and archive flashcards which have been correctly answered several times.</p> <p>The app also includes an admin dashboard for managing users and flashcard content.",
