                Headshot with some kind of custom graphic behind it?
                synopsis/intro
                pics of TRS-80 (look up HTML caption thingy)
                Special menu in lieu of navbar - decide how to handle responsive layout so menu is not too far down

                Maybe headshot & summary on left (max 300px wide), menu in center, longer history to the far right

                My Journey into Tech

                1983 - TRS-80 & DOS
                1986 - NES
                1989 - Word processing, 
                1995 - 2000 Applied to WashU for CS/Arch but... did take FORTRAN 77 and Intro to Computing (HTML! e-mail!) - eventually also learned AutoCAD, RISA, Form-Z, MATLAB, and more.
                2001 - Learned TADS to write interactive fiction, learned GIMP for graphic design
                2003 - Learned CSS and assisted with designing the architecture for an Access database to track donors and sponsors; helped maintain website through 2014
                2015 - Learned Adobe Illustrator and InDesign for professional-level publications and graphic design (reverse that)
                2019 - Decided to take the plunge to switch careers, and took online course in Python while waiting for LC101 to begin; voraciously plowed through hundreds of practice problems on HackerRank, CodeWars, CodingBat, etc.
                2020 - Completed capstone project, began apprenticeship, and started mentoring students in CoderGirl; created new content to supplement LC curriculum
                2021 - completed in-depth Udemy course on Angular; continuing to add new content for students

                Somewhere in there, talk about how I am always the person everyone comes to for help for anything computer-related

                I am a natural leader but I have learned the value of making sure everyone has a contribution that best fits their skills
