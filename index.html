                        <p>My journey into tech has been almost entirely non-traditional, but a long time coming. From my earliest days learning DOS on a Tandy, to a couple of required CS classes in college, then 20 years in the nonprofit sector working with whatever cobbled-together technology I had available to me, I have generally been the person that everyone comes to for help with their computers, whether it was my job or not. (It wasn't, but I am always happy to help!)</p>
                        <p>It took a battle with cancer in 2017 to wake me up to the realization that I wanted to do whatever it took to switch to a career in tech. Enter <a href="https://www.launchcode.org" target="_blank">LaunchCode</a> &mdash; and the many wonderful people who taught me, mentored me, and encouraged me along the way &mdash; and I have achieved my dream! As a web developer, software engineer, and mentor to students, I love that I am constantly learning new things, and I am so looking forward to continuing this journey ahead of me.</p>
