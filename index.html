                        <p>My journey into tech has been almost entirely non-traditional, but a long time coming. From my earliest days learning DOS on a Tandy, to a couple of required CS classes in college, then 20 years in the nonprofit sector working with whatever cobbled-together technology I had available to me, I have generally been the person that everyone comes to for help with their computers, whether it was my job or not. (It wasn't, but I am always happy to help!)</p>
                        <p>It took a battle with cancer in 2017 to wake me up to the realization that I wanted to do whatever it took to switch to a career in tech. Enter <a href="https://www.launchcode.org" target="_blank">LaunchCode</a> &mdash; and the many wonderful people who taught me, mentored me, and encouraged me along the way &mdash; and I have achieved my dream! As a web developer, software engineer, and mentor to students, I love that I am constantly learning new things, and I am so looking forward to continuing this journey ahead of me.</p>

My favorite thing was making pictures out of characters, line by line, to be printed out on the dot matrix printer. In a way, I think this was my first introduction to coding concepts.</td>

I still have my console hooked up to my TV, and from time to time I pull out Super Mario Bros., the Legend of Zelda, Tetris, Ultima, or others for a good dose of nostalgia. I think it was during this period that I really became fascinated with the idea about how these programs were created even though I didn't know what code looked like yet.</td>

I learned HTML (such as it was), checked my e-mail in PINE using Telnet, and occasionally took breaks to play Acrophobia on IRC. A class on numerical methods introduced me to FORTRAN and MATLAB, a drafting class covered AutoCAD, and in the architecture school I was introduced to rendering programs like Form-Z.</td>

I decided to learn the TADS platform and coded several stories/games over the next couple of years, just for fun. Around this same time I started using the GIMP for graphic design.</td>

I started studying a few things on the side, like Python, but things really took off when I was accepted into LaunchCode's LC101 program and learned multiple languages, tools, and platforms in a short amount of time.
